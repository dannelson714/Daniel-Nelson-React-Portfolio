# Daniel-Nelson-React-Portfolio

## Description

In this project I created a React-based deployment of my professional developer website. My goal was to create an easily navigated, visually appealing page that clearly linked to projects and followed industry best practices.

The primary problems that I solved were learning to effectively employ React to
create a single page site that would re-render based on the tabs the user selected.
Each tab had unique challenges, such as correctly manipulating props to pass up and
down the chain of component dependencies and using state variables to properly
manage a simple contact form.
